# Foodstagram

Foodstagram is a project I made for the React Native course as Laurea University of Applied Sciences - Finland. 

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js installed to use npm, which is necessary to install yarn and the Expo CLI.

Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Then, install yarn and Expo CLI globally using npm:

npm install --global yarn expo-cli

### Installing
Clone the Foodstagram repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/maixuanlinh/Foodstagram.git

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project:
cd Foodstagram

Install all the required dependencies with yarn:
yarn install

### Running the App
Start the application with the following command:
expo start
This command will open a new tab in your default web browser with the Expo developer tools. A QR code will be displayed in the terminal and the browser.

### On Your Mobile Device:
Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone.
Scan the QR code using your phone's camera (iOS) or the Expo app (Android).
The app should now start building and will be available for you to test on your device.

Built With
React Native - The framework used for developing the mobile app.
Expo - An open-source platform used for building native applications.
